Voxel Engine
============
A basic voxel rendering engine.


Project Setup
------------
You will need to download the [lib][lib_zip] directory and extract it so that you get a file-structure like:

```sh
voxel_engine/
    lib/
        bin/
        include/
        symbols/
    src/
        browser/
        constants/
        rendering/
        spatial/
        utility/
```

I decided to keep the lib directory separate from the repo since it contains binary and symbol files which I don't really think should be a part of the version control.
